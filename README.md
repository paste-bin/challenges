# challenges
This is a collection of CTF Challenges of highly varying quality  
Some will be written by me, with a well documented exploit, a walkthrough, and instructions on how to set up the challenge. Others will be random notes I made 2 years ago in the middle of a ctf with the zip I downloaded for the original challenge _if you're lucky_  


### Dump
I'm not sure what half of these are, most likely I downloaded them durring a ctf and dindn't get a chance to look at them.  

### Brain dumps
With these, you get a least a vague idea what the challenge is and maybe a broken exploit

### Ok bunch
These are an ok bunch of challenges, I seem to at least remember solving these ones. If I had to make a CTF in a pinch, I'd probably steal parts from here

### The Good Stuff
These are the ones that really stretched my brain and I may have even made a blog post about them


## Wargames
I've intentionally left my solutions to wargames out (some slipped in)
